Only the `sjcl.js` file of this directory is used by Belenios. The
`core/*.js` files are given for reference and compliance with Debian
Free Software Guidelines (DFSG).

`sjcl.js` is generated by concatenating the files listed in
`core/INDEX` and applying your favourite minifier. A `Makefile` using
`yui-compressor` is given as example.
